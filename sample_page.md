## A Walkthrough of TDA Applied to Color Modeling

**Project description:** The discipline of Topology is concerned with several notions, including continuity, "conectedness" and especially "closeness." Topology also offers up a set of objects that allow us to parse through multi-dimensional data geometrically and gather meaningful information about the data. This project is a brief effort in showing how data and Topology can be united to model data.
